# Theme-Picker

Source code is from fossheim.io: [Building an accessible theme picker with HTML, CSS and JavaScript](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/accessible-theme-picker-html-css-js/)

What I changed: I separated the js part from the html file, added some button animation parts, and changed the theme to the four commonly used Morandi color themes.
